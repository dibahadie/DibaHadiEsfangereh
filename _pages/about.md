I am Diba Hadi Esfangereh, a third-year Computer Engineering student at Sharif University of Technology with a passion for exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. My research interests lie at the intersection of Neurosymbolic AI, Automated Reasoning, Statistical Machine Learning, and Cognitive Science. I am fascinated by the potential of combining neural and symbolic methods to create AI systems capable of complex reasoning and robust learning.

My work often bridges disciplines, as I strive to understand and address foundational challenges such as representation learning, data limitations, out-of-distribution generalization, and open set recognition. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to projects that explore the integration of structured knowledge with statistical learning, aiming to create systems that mirror the depth and versatility of human cognition.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep love for music, which I express through playing multiple instruments, singing in traditional Persian styles, and studying the art of music generation. This passion has inspired me to explore innovative approaches to Neuro-Symbolic Music Generation, blending symbolic reasoning with deep learning techniques to overcome challenges in this creative domain.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to the advancement of AI systems that are not only technically robust but also capable of reasoning and understanding in ways that align with human cognition.

## Research Interests

My academic pursuits reflect my fascination with cognitive and computational paradigms. Some of my key interests include:

- Combining symbolic reasoning and deep learning to tackle challenges in Music Generation.
- Exploring innovative solutions for Automated Reasoning and Constraint Satisfaction Problems.
- Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization and Open Set Recognition.

## Music and Creativity

Music is an integral part of my life. I have a deep appreciation for Persian traditional music and have learned to play instruments like the guitar and piano. I also enjoy singing in traditional Persian style. My curiosity for the language of music has driven me to explore Neuro-Symbolic approaches to Music Generation, overcoming data limitations and advancing creative AI applications.
