# About Me

Welcome to my academic website! I am **Diba Hadi Esfangereh**, a third-year Computer Engineering student at **Sharif University of Technology**. My research interests span across **Neurosymbolic AI**, **Automated Reasoning**, **Statistical Machine Learning**, and **Cognitive Science**, with a particular focus on **Representation Learning**.

## Academic Background

I am passionate about exploring the intersection of symbolic reasoning and neural networks, striving to bridge the gap between the structured nature of symbolic knowledge and the statistical power of deep learning. I am currently applying for a research project on **Symbolic Representation Learning**, which aims to enhance AI systems' ability to represent and reason with structured language.

## Projects and Achievements

- **National Mathematics Olympiad**: Silver Medalist.
- **Music Generation Research**: Participated in Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani's project on **Persian Music Generation**.
- **Music Generation Platform**: Currently working on a **Neuro-Symbolic Music Generation Platform**, focusing on classical music and melody generation.
- **Key Segmentation & Search Algorithms**: Designed libraries and algorithms for advanced computational tasks.

## Research Interests

My academic pursuits reflect my fascination with cognitive and computational paradigms. Some of my key interests include:

- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization** and **Open Set Recognition**.
- Combining **symbolic reasoning** and **deep learning** to tackle challenges in **Music Generation**.
- Exploring innovative solutions for **Automated Reasoning** and **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**.

## Music and Creativity

Music is an integral part of my life. I have a deep appreciation for **Persian traditional music** and have learned to play instruments like the **guitar** and **piano**. I also enjoy singing in traditional Persian style. My curiosity for the **language of music** has driven me to explore **Neuro-Symbolic approaches to Music Generation**, overcoming data limitations and advancing creative AI applications.
